These web pages hopefully provide some information that may help your stay at the flat.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Utility cut-offs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gas - the main cut-off valve is on the gas pipe by the gas meter, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Electricity - the main switch is on the consumer unit, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Water - the riser stop cock is at the back of the cupboard under the oven. NB there is no water meter.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Spare bulbs, hoover bags</h3>
Spare bulbs in the kitchen drawers.  Replacement should be:
<ul>
<li>Kitchen - MR11 LED Lamp 4.5W 36 deg beam. Eg  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N8Q93AQ" title="Bulbs on Amazon">these</a> </li>
<li>Bathroom spotlights - Eveready MR11 Halogen Lamp 20W 38 deg beam. Eg  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eveready-Dichroic-MR11-Halogen-38DEG/dp/B0052E8EQ6" title="Bulbs on Amazon">these</a></li>
<li>Lounge uplighters - they need to be dimmable otherwise a) they don't dim well, and b) after a while the dimmer circuit blows. Replacements should be 470lm dimmable LED, 2700K/warm white, B22/bayonet fitting to match the others, which are "LAP GLS 5W" from Screwfix, alas Screwfix don't sell them any more.</a>.</li>
<li>Entrance & WC, 5.5w, 470lm 2700k, eg £1 'Ultrabrite' mini-globes at Poundland in Hoxton Street.</li>
<li>Get vacuum cleaner bags for the 'James' either from <a href="https://www.myhenry.com/accessories-and-consumables/henry-hepaflo-filter-bags">myhenry.com</a>, £4.50 for 3 or £10 for 10 free delivery, or walk down to Argos (on Old Street, 7 min walk) and get 10 for £10 over the counter.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Detectors</h3>
Checking the smoke and carbon monoxide alarms is easy and definitely worth-while!
<ul>
<li>smoke/heat detectors - although these have batteries as a backup, they are mains-powered normally so their batteries rarely need replacing. Each has a 'test' push button, and as they are interconnected, they should all beep when just one button is pushed.</li>
<li>carbon monoxide alarm - these start to beep and show 'lb' when the battery is low.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Cleaning materials</h3>
Spare cleaning gear might be found under the kitchen sink:
<ul>
<li>dishwasher - all-in-one tablets are easiest (combining salt and rinse-aid).</li>
<li>wooden floor - generally just wipe with a damp cloth, but can be polished with mansion wax.</li>
<li>island worksurface - teak oil.</li>
<li>bathroom limestone - just soapy water.</li>
</ul>
