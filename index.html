These web pages hopefully provide some information that may help your stay at the flat.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Utility cut-offs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gas - the main cut-off valve is on the gas pipe by the gas meter, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Electricity - the main switch is on the consumer unit, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Water - the riser stop cock is at the back of the cupboard under the oven.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Detectors and Alarms</h3>
It is the occupants' responsibility, and in their best interest, to notice flat batteries in the 
detectors - generally it's very easy to do:
<ul>
<li>smoke detectors - each has a push button battery check: if they beep when pushed then they're working!</li>
<li>carbon monoxide alarm - starts to beep and show 'lb' when the battery is low.</li>
<li>security alarm - the number pad has a low battery warning light: if lit, tell the landlord.</li>
</ul>
