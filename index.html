These web pages hopefully provide some information that may help your stay at the flat.

<br>
<h3>Utility cut-offs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gas - the main cut-off valve is on the gas pipe by the gas meter, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Electricity - the main switch is on the consumer unit, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Water - the riser stop cock is at the back of the cupboard under the oven. NB there is no water meter.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Bulbs</h3>
Spare bulbs in the kitchen drawers.  Replacement should be:
<ul>
<li>Kitchen - MR11 LED Lamp 4.5W 36 deg beam. Eg  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N8Q93AQ" title="Bulbs on Amazon">these</a> </li>
<li>Bathroom spotlights - Eveready MR11 Halogen Lamp 20W 38 deg beam. Eg  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eveready-Dichroic-MR11-Halogen-38DEG/dp/B0052E8EQ6" title="Bulbs on Amazon">these</a></li>
<li>Lounge uplighters - they need to be dimmable otherwise a) they don't dim well, and b) after a while the dimmer circuit blows. Old inefficient filament bulbs are always dimmable but hard to get now. Dimmable halogens are OK, eg <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/a60/Opus-Bayonet-Halogen-Light-Bulbs-Dimmable-Energy/B018A4GHUO">these</a> or <a href="https://www.homebase.co.uk/halogen-classic-bc-28w-light-bulb-pack-of-2_p343026">these</a>.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Detectors</h3>
Checking the smoke and carbon monoxide alarms is easy and definitely worth-while!
<ul>
<li>smoke detectors - each has a push button battery check: if they beep when pushed then they're working!</li>
<li>carbon monoxide alarm - starts to beep and show 'lb' when the battery is low.</li>
<li>security alarm - the number pad has a low battery warning light: if lit, tell the landlord.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Cleaning materials</h3>
Spare cleaning gear might be found under the kitchen sink:
<ul>
<li>dishwasher - all-in-one tablets are easiest (combining salt and rinse-aid).</li>
<li>wooden floor - generally just wipe with a damp cloth, but can be polished with mansion wax.</li>
<li>island worksurface - teak oil.</li>
<li>bathroom limestone - just soapy water.</li>
</ul>
