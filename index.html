These web pages hopefully provide some information that may help your stay at the flat.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Utility cut-offs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gas - the main cut-off valve is on the gas pipe by the gas meter, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Electricity - the main switch is on the consumer unit, in the cupboard by the kitchen window.</li>
<li>Water - the riser stop cock is at the back of the cupboard under the oven. NB there is no water meter.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Spare bulbs, hoover bags</h3>
Spare bulbs in the kitchen drawers.  All replacements should be LED, filament type when possible as they are more efficient. For normal bayonet clip (BC aka B22) bulbs, I generally recommend 'candle' or 'mini globes' as they are easiest to put in and remove:
<ul>
<li>Bedroom main lights are all B22, minimum 800 lumen (60W equivalent), eg <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-home-led-filament-standard-60w-bc-light-bulb-2pk">Sainsbury's, £5 for 2</a>.</li>
<li>Entrance, WC and landing - all B22, 470 lumen (40W equivalent), 2700k/warm white, eg <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-home-led-filament-candle-40w-bc-light-bulb-2pk">Sainsbury's, £5 for 2</a>..</li>
<li>Lounge uplighters - all B22, <i>dimmable,</i> 470lm, 2700K/warm white, eg <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-home-led-filament-standard-60w-bc-dim-light-bulb-2pk">Sainsbury's Home LED Filament Standard 60W BC Dimmable, £6 for 2</a>. NB they must be dimmable otherwise a) they don't dim well, and b) after a while the dimmer circuit burns out (expensive to fix...)!</li>
<li>Desk lamps should have low power 250lm (~ 25W equivalent) bulbs, eg:</li>
 <ul>
 <li> for E14 (aka SES, small Edison screw) lamps: <a href="https://www.screwfix.com/p/lap-ses-candle-led-light-bulb-250lm-3w/779fh">SES candle LED 250lm 3W from Screwfix</a>.</li>
 <li> for the GU10 desk lamp: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eveready-2X-3w-LED-GU10-110/dp/B07KSCBBT2/ref=sr_1_8"/>Eveready 3W wide beam (110°)</a> - NB the more common 38° spotlight bulbs are not suitable for desk lights.</li>
 </ul>
<li>Bathroom spotlights - 5W, MR11 GU4, wide beam (> 90°), natural white. Eg these on eBay <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/353852147203" title="Bulbs on Amazon">£12 for four</a>.</li>
<li>Kitchen pendants - dimmable MR11 GU4 base LED 4.5W 36 deg beam; these are the most difficult to find - I have a couple left, best to contact me to replace them.</li>
<li>Get vacuum cleaner bags for the 'James' either from <a href="https://www.myhenry.com/accessories-and-consumables/henry-hepaflo-filter-bags">myhenry.com</a>, £4.50 for 3 or £10 for 10 free delivery, or walk down to Argos (on Old Street, 7 min walk) and get 10 for £10 over the counter.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Detectors</h3>
Checking the smoke and carbon monoxide alarms is easy and definitely worth-while!
<ul>
<li>smoke/heat detectors - although these have batteries as a backup, they are mains-powered normally so their batteries rarely need replacing. Each has a 'test' push button, and as they are interconnected, they should all beep when just one button is pushed.</li>
<li>carbon monoxide alarm - these start to beep and show 'lb' when the battery is low.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Cleaning materials</h3>
Spare cleaning gear might be found under the kitchen sink:
<ul>
<li>dishwasher - all-in-one tablets are easiest (combining salt and rinse-aid).</li>
<li>wooden floor - generally just wipe with a damp cloth, but can be polished with mansion wax.</li>
<li>island worksurface - teak oil.</li>
<li>bathroom limestone - just soapy water.</li>
</ul>
